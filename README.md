## Goal of the Project

The project aims to design an interactive queries function of SQL (by connecting the database from Azure) to evaluate the KPI performance.

* First, local Database (DB) connection to Azure has been executed by using `Azure Database for MySQL single server`(use `Migration Wizard`).
* Second, in the codespace, you need `Hostname`,`Username`, and `Password` provided by Azure server to connect to your codespace.
* In codespace, you will be able to access `Database` which is exactly the same as the Azure database, and with this, I created a Datawarehouse and loaded all the needed data from the DB.
* KPI.sql is the interactive queries that you can perfrom in the codespace.

* The goal of this project is to let KPI evaluation being more efficient and updatable by connecting to a cloud space.
